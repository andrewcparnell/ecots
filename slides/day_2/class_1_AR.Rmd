- Understand the key parts that make up a stationary time series
- Know what an Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) function is
- Understand how a random walk process is generated
- Understand the AR(p) process

## The most important slide in the course

\Large

Almost all of time series is based on two ideas:

1. Base your future predictions on previous values of the data
1. Base your future predictions on how wrong you were in your past predictions

The remainder of the course is focussed on applying these two ideas in increasingly complex situations

For today we only discuss _discrete time series_, i.e. where $t = 1, 2, 3, ...$

## Recall: decomposing time series

- We decompose time series commonly as:
$$y_t = \mbox{trend}_t + \mbox{seasonality}_t + \mbox{error}_t$$

- ... but sometimes it is not easy to separate these into different parts

- The concept of _stationarity_ helps us decompose the time series

## A time series with a big trend?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
x <- cumsum(sample(c(-1, 1), size=500, replace=TRUE))
plot(x, type = 'l')
```

## Generating the series

```{r, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(123)
y <- cumsum(sample(c(-1, 1), size=1000, replace=TRUE))
```

- The `sample` command just produces a set of 1000 values either -1 or 1
- `cumsum` just cumulatively adds them up
- This is a _random walk_ series

##  And what happens when we continue the series?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(y, type = 'l')
```

## Generating a one-dimensional random walk

1. Start at zero
2. Flip a coin and move (+1) for heads (-1) for tails
3. Repeat

Where do you end up?
- Expected mean is 0 as number of steps gets large
$$ \hat{Y}_{t} = Y_{t-1} $$

- The variance of the series gets larger as you move into the future
- But in an infinite series, every point (including zero) is crossed an infinite number of times. This causes the __gambler's ruin__

## Random walk applications

The steps don't have to be the same size.

- A step size with a Gaussian distribution is useful for modelling stock markets 
- If the step size probability distribution is heavy tailed, we have _Levy flight_
- They also don't have to be in 1 dimension. We can simulate random walks in 2, 3, ... dimensions by adding multivariate steps

## Levy flight vs Brownian motion in 2D

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{LevyFlight.png} &

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

There is evidence that animals such as sharks follow a levy flight pattern (left) when foraging for food - they had previously been thought to approximate Brownian motion (right)

## Diagnosing time series behaviour

- A useful way to characterise the behaviour of a time series is the _autocorrelation_ function 
- (_auto_ = _self_, i.e. correlation of the series with itself)
- We calculate the correlation of the series with itself shifted by 1 time point
- The shifted data set is known as the _lagged_ time series
- We repeat the autocorrelation calculation for 1 lag, 2 lags, 3 lags, etc

## Plotting the acf

- R has a function `acf` which will plot this for you
```{r, fig.height = 5}
acf(y)
```

This random walk series has very high autocorrelation

## A real acf

- With seasonal data, you might see patterns in the ACF
```{r, fig.height = 4}
lynx = read.csv('../../data/lynx.csv')
acf(lynx$number)
```

- R automatically shows significance levels for the ACF plot

# Autoregressive models

## Autoregressive (AR) models

- Autoregressive models literally perform a linear regression of the time series against the previous lag of the series

- For example, an AR(1) process can be written as:
$$y_{t} = \alpha + \beta y_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}$$

- where $\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ just like a linear regression. 

- In a probability distribution format, we might write:
$$y_t \sim N(\alpha + \beta y_{t-1}, \sigma^2)$$
... and maximise the likelihood as normal

## Interpretation of the AR parameters

- $\alpha$ is an estimate of the stable mean of the process
- $\beta$ is interesting:

    - Values close to 1 indicate that the series is almost like a random walk. 
    - Values close to 0 indicate that the series is almost completely composed of random normally-distributed error terms
    - Values less than 0 indicate that the series is 'repulsive'
    - Values greater than 1 (or less than -1) indicate that the series is chaotic

## Simulating from an AR(1) process

- We can simulate from an AR(1) process with:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(123)
T = 1000
t_seq = 1:T
sigma = 0.4
alpha = 1
beta = 0.6
y = rep(NA,T)
y[1] = rnorm(1,0,sigma)
for(t in 2:T) y[t] = rnorm(1,alpha + beta * y[t-1], 
                           sigma)
```
- It's fun to play around with values of beta and see what happens to the model

## Some features of an AR(1) process

- For an AR(1) process, the ACF decays exponentially if $\beta<1$
- We can see this if we look at the acf
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height = 4}
acf(y)
```

## Extending the AR model

- An AR(2) process is written as:
$$y_{t} = \alpha + \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \beta_2 y_{t-2} + \epsilon_{t}$$

- An AR(p) process can be written as:
$$y_{t} = \alpha + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \beta_{i} y_{t-i} + \epsilon_{t}$$
- The restrictions on the values of $\beta_i$ get much more complicated as $p$ increases to avoid a chaotic series

## The partial autocorrelation function

- Another commonly plotted summary statistic from a time series is the _partial autocorrelation function_ or PACF

- The PACF at lag k is created by:

    1. Creating an AR(k-1) model
    1. Getting the residuals $\hat{\epsilon}_t$
    1. Calculating the autocorrelation function between the data and the residuals
  
- You can think of it as being the autocorrelation function for lag k having _removed_ the effect of the lower level lags  
  
## A plot of the PACF

- The ACF and PACF for the AR(1) process we generated
```{r, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
acf(y)
pacf(y)
```

## Some rules about ACF and PACF

- In general for an AR(p) process:

    - There will be exponential decay in the ACF
    - There will be $p$ sticking out ('significant') lags in the PACF

Thus you can have a good initial guess at identifying $p$ in an AR(p) model from the ACF and PACF

## Simulating from an AR(p) process

\small

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height = 3}
set.seed(100)
T = 500
t_seq = 1:T
sigma = alpha = 1
p = 3
beta = sort(runif(p, 0, 0.2), decreasing = TRUE)
y = rep(NA,T)
y[1:p] = rnorm(p, mean = alpha, sd = sigma)
for(t in (p+1):T) 
  y[t] = rnorm(1,
               alpha + sum( beta * y[(t-1):(t-p)] ),
               sigma)
plot(t_seq,y,type='l')
```

## PACF for our example AR3 process
```{r, echo=FALSE}
pacf(y)
```

## Predicting the future

- Once we have our model we have an easy way to predict the future:
$$\hat{y}_{t+1} = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta} y_t$$

- If we want to forecast further ahead we have to start using the forecast values, e.g.
$$\hat{y}_{t+2} = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta} \hat{y}_{t+1}$$
- We can create a confidence interval for our predictions by using the standard errors of $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$
- We can create a _prediction interval_ by also including the values $\hat{\sigma}$ and simulating from the full probability distribution

## Stationarity

- One of the key concepts in time series is _stationarity_
- A time series is said to be weakly stationary if:

    1. The mean is stable
    1. The variance is stable
    1. The autocorrelation doesn't depend on where you are in the series
  
- The first can be checked from plots of the time series, but the last one is quite tricky
- All AR models are stationary provided the restrictions on $\beta$ are met

## What if a series isn't stationary?

- If a time series isn't stationary we might:

    - stabilise the mean by removing the trend or seasonality (by e.g. using linear regression)
    - make the variance stable by performing a transformation such as log or Box-Cox
    - fit a more advanced non-stationary model (see later in the course)
    
- Quite often, when a series is not mean or variance stationary, people will _difference_ the time series, and fit models only to the differences
- You can also _seasonally difference_ the data

## Fitting models in R

- The R function `Arima` in the `forecast` package will fit AR models for you
- To fit an AR(1) model to data $y$ we just type:
```{r}
Arima(y, order = c(1, 0, 0))
```

## Summary

- The ACF and PACF are two really useful tools to run on every time series (as well as a plot of the time series itself)
- The AR(p) framework is a class of models for stationary time series which regresses the current values of the series on past values
- A time series is stationary if it has stable mean and standard deviation, and an ACF which doesn't change over time
- There are lots of ways to make a series stationary. The most common one is differencing
